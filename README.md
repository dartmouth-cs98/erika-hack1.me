# Erika Ogino 

## Description 
Followed tutorial on codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website
Tutorial is listed to take 9 hours 
Built four simple websites (can be seen under each exercise folder), each with increasing complexity. Some files or outlines of files were supplied by codeacedemy. In these cases, it is indicated in the header.

Then followed first assignment in CS 52:
http://cs52.me/assignments/sa/localdev/
Domain created: http://erika-hack1.me

Then created my own webpage with insider tips to Hanover restaurants from scratch. Incorporated aspects I learned from the tutorials such as Bootstrap, and inserting links and photos. Asked my friends for ideas for the webpage and interviewed my friends for tips (small scale crowdsourcing of information)

## What I learned 
Basics of HTML and CSS 
Using Bootstrap 
How to claim a domain and use github pages 

## What didn't work 
I think it would have been nice to have the context of the lectures when following the SA, but obviously that would not have been possible since I'm not taking the class 

I also wish that codecademy did not give you as much supporting files for each exercise since it made the user feel as if they could accomplish more than they could realistically could without the supporting files 

By going through the process of collecting insider tips for the webpage, I realized how the quality of the content depended heavily on the willingness of people to give information and the quality of the information my friends had. For example, for some restaurants I was not able to get good tips because the people I asked did not have good tips for the restaurant. Additionally, while my friends were passionate about restaurants in town and sharing tips, if the topic had been something they were not as interested in, I may not have been able to get as much information. This process helped me realize that whatever project I end up doing, it will probably be easier if the product does not depend on the quality/ quantity of information that someone else is able to give me.
