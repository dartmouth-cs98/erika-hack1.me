# Erika Ogino 

## Description 
Followed tutorial on codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website
Tutorial is listed to take 9 hours 
Built four simple websites (can be seen under each exercise folder), each with increasing complexity. Some files or outlines of files were supplied by codeacedemy. In these cases, it is indicated in the header.

Then followed first assignment in CS 52:

Domain created: http://erika-hack1.me

Then created my own webpage with insider tips to Hanover restaurants from scratch. Incorporated aspects I learned from the tutorials such as Bootstrap, and inserting links and photos. Interviewed my friends for tips 

## What I learned 
Basics of HTML and CSS 
Using Bootstrap 
How to claim a domain and use github pages 

## What didn't work 
I think it would have been nice to have the context of the lectures when following the SA, but obviously that would not have been possible since I'm not taking the class 

I also wish that codecademy did not give you as much supporting files for each exercise since it made the user feel as if they could accomplish more than they could realistically could without the supporting files 

Whenever I build, the build is completed successfully, but I receive an error message about needing to update my DNS.
